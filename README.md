Israel Tech Challenge Data Science Fellows Fall 20219 Final Project 

Project ideas:
1. rienforcent learning: teach the computer to plat the 2D game icy tower
2. generative model: based on this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VAkrUNLKSo
but with nature sceneries
3. **The problem:** People are finding themselves in a downward spiral on the internet where they are doing things that hurt their mental health. There is no way of accurately assessing a users mental state in order to take steps to help them.

**Solution:** One of our ideas aims to recreate and improve on the accuracy and scope of emotion detection using a live feed instead of a single image like was done in previous projects. The idea would be to take a live feed from a user’s web camera and run an algorithm in the background that labels that users current mood in real time. 

If we are able to achieve this goal easily, an extension of the idea would be to use this information somehow - one possibility would be to create a chrome extension that obfuscates certain words on the browser if the user’s sentiment is below a certain threshold. A further extension of this would be to try to keep a history of the effect of these changes to the user and optimize the obfuscation for maximum results. 

Another extension of the first goal could be to send an inspirational message or suggest a screen break.

The Test Metrics: A simple accuracy metric could be used for the emotion detection since we have labeled data. However, if we want to detect depression for example, we may weight a false negative higher than a false positive. 

**The Data:** Extended Cohn-Kanade Dataset
